# MIPS-32bit-pipelined
This is a Verilog simulation of a 32-bit MIPS pipelined processsor.MIPS is a RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture.My code implements some basic instructions which can be used to write many basic yet useful and practical programs in a high-level language like C/C++.The instructions implemented are :ADD,SUB,AND,OR,SLT,LW,SW,ADDI,and BEQ.
The instructions used to test the simulation are included in the file "memfile.dat" and the corresponding MIPS assembly language instructions are given in the file             "Test Instructions.txt".
